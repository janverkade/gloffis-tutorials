# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

In the present series of tutorials, it is shown how various `gloffis` data products can be accessed. The explanations are accompanied by a very brief introduction of the Deltares hydrological forecasting service its products.

## The Deltares hydrological forecasting service {#sec-gloffis-intro}

The forecasting system includes hydrological models of the wflow[^index-1] type. The hydrological model estimates the value of various variables including streamflow and actual evaporation rates and soil moisture levels. The output is gridded in nature; see @fig-streamflow-simulation-lempa for an example.

## Tutorials

The tutorials include exploration of:

-   historical streamflow simulations;
-   medium-term forecasts, and
-   seasonal forecasts.

And also includes a section on visualization examples.
