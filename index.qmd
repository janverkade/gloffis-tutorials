# Introduction {#sec-introduction}
In the present series of tutorials, it is shown how various `gloffis` data products can be accessed. Accompanied by brief introduction of the Deltares hydrological forecasting service its products.

## The Deltares hydrological forecasting service {#sec-gloffis-intro}
The forecasting system includes hydrological models of the wflow[^1] type. The hydrological model estimates the value of various variables including streamflow and actual evaporation rates and soil moisture levels. The output is gridded in nature; see @fig-streamflow-simulation-lempa for an example.

Model simulations of the recent past are based on weather parameters estimated by the ERA5 product[^2]. Model simulations are available from 1981 through the present time. Into the future, the SEAS5 seasonal forecast product[^3] is used. These seasonal forecasts, that have been bias corrected, run from the current time until some months into the future. Both historical and forecasted time series are produced at grids.

## Data access
API and file-based. Currently, tutorial contains file-based approach only. API approach to follow.


## Tutorials
The tutorials include exploration and visualization of:

-   historical streamflow simulations;

-   medium-term forecasts;

-   flood threshold exceedance probabilities;

-   seasonal forecasts, and

-   drought indicators.

In @sec-medium-term-forecasts, you'll ...
